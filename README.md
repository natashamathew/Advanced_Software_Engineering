Server was hosted on AWS EC2 instance, Ubuntu 18. PHP7. Apache2.

The data modeling was done with MySQL workbench, so the files should be easily imported to view and make proposed edits.
Database was set up as an AWS RDS instance MySQL 8.0.11, with updates to the tables being done by running the DDL and DML scripts.
